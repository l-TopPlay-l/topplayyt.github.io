		<h1>Good morning/afternoon everyone,</h1>
		
		
		<h3>
            Today we're going to talk about the pros and cons of long flights.
            As someone who travels frequently, I can confidently say that there are both 
            good and bad aspects to long-haul journeys.
		</h3>
		
		<h2>Let's start with the bad:</h2>
		
		<p><kbd>Jet Lag:</kbd> One of the biggest challenges of long flights is dealing with jet lag. It can disrupt your sleep patterns, affect your mood, and even impact your health.</p>
        
        <p><kbd>Boredom:</kbd> Being stuck in a small space for several hours with limited entertainment options can lead to boredom and restlessness.</p>
        
        <p><kbd>Discomfort:</kbd> Long flights can be uncomfortable, with limited space to move around and stretch your legs. This can result in stiffness and even the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).</p>
        
		<p><kbd>Limited Food Options:</kbd> In-flight meals are often limited in terms of choice and quality, which can be frustrating for travelers with dietary restrictions or allergies.</p>
		

		
		<h2>Now, let's move onto the good:</h2>
        
        
        <p><kbd>Time to Unwind:</kbd> Long flights provide an opportunity to unwind and disconnect from the stresses of everyday life. You can catch up on sleep, read a book, or enjoy a movie without interruptions from work or social media.</p>
        
        <p><kbd>Opportunity to Plan: </kbd> Long flights can provide the perfect opportunity to plan your trip, read up on your destination, and even learn a new language.</p>
        
        <p><kbd>Cultural Experience:</kbd> Long flights can also provide a cultural experience. From the food and drinks on the flight to the movies and TV shows offered, you can get a taste of the culture of your destination before you even arrive.</p>
        
        <p><kbd>Chance to Meet New People:</kbd> Finally, long flights can provide a chance to meet new people. Whether it's striking up a conversation with your seatmate or chatting with other passengers in the lounge, you never know who you might meet.</p>
